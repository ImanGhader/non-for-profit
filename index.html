			<h5>What we do</h5>
			<p>We establish community library and resource centers (READ Centers) in rural villages in South Asia, where a majority of women are illiterate, and most families live below the poverty line. All of our Centers are owned and operated by the local community, and offer training programs to people of all ages and backgrounds.</p>

			<p>Since 1991, the READ model has evolved from the idea of a rural library to a thriving network of READ Centers and sustaining enterprises in Bhutan, India and Nepal.</p>
