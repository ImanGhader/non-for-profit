		<p>READ (Rural Education and Development) Global believes that empowering rural
		communities is key to alleviating global poverty. READ partners with rural villages to establish community
		library and resource centers (READ Centers) as vehicles for social and economic transformation. More than half of women are illiterate in South Asia,
		and in the rural communities where READ works, few economic opportunities exist. </p>

	<div class=unit unit-xs-1 unit-s-1 unit-m-1-2 unit-l-1-2>
		<p>Centers are owned and operated by the local community, and offer training programs to people of all ages and backgrounds
		in the areas of education, economic empowerment, technology, and women's empowerment.</p>

		<p>Since 1991, the READ model has evolved from the simple idea of a rural library to a thriving network of READ Centers and sustaining enterprises.
		To date, 71 READ Centers and 103 sustaining enterprises have been established across Bhutan, India and Nepal, providing access to more than 2 million rural villagers.</p>

		<p>Every day, rural villagers are visiting READ Centers and improving their reading skills, gaining new livelihood skills to help them earn a living,
		learning how to access the Internet or accessing critical health information.</p>

          <h2> Why Bhutan?</h2>
          <p>Although Bhutan is known for the beauty of its mountains and "Gross National Happiness",
          most of the population lives in remote areas with rugged terrain and
          few educational or economic opportunities. Bhutan has one of the lowest literacy rates in Asia,
          and before READ established our first Center there, there was only one public lending library in the entire country.
          Bhutan was closed off from the rest of the modern world until the 1960s.
					READ Global is one of the only international non-profit organizations operating in Bhutan. </p>
